**Welcome to my website!**

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Washington University in St. Louis and a Research Fellow at the University of Basel.

I'm on the 2019-2020 job market. I will be available for interviews the 18th and 19th of December at the 2019 European Job Market in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and from the 3rd to the 5th of January at the 2020 ASSA Meetings in San Diego, CA.

I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Basel in spring 2019. During my PhD years I worked as a lecturer and research and teaching assistant in the [Economic Theory Group](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/economictheory/) led by [Prof. Aleksander Berentsen](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/berentsen/).

My current research is focused on the macro and monetary economics of developing countries with a particular emphasis on frictional markets and related issues such as informality, financial exclusion and dollarization.

On this website you can find my detailed CV as well as an overview of my work.
