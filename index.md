**Welcome to my website!**

I am an Economist at the African Department of the [International Monetary Fund (IMF)](https://www.imf.org/en/Home). My research focuses on macroeconomics and monetary economics, with a particular interest in markets with frictions.

Before joining the IMF, I served as an Assistant Professor of Economics in the [Department of Finance and Economics](http://www.qu.edu.qa/business/academic-departments/finance) at Qatar University and as a Research Fellow with the [Economic Theory Group](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/faculty/people/berentsen-aleksander-economic-theory/) at the University of Basel.

I earned my PhD in Economics from the University of Basel in 2019. Following my doctoral studies, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis.

This website offers a detailed CV and an overview of my research and professional activities.
