**Welcome to my website!**

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Washington University in St. Louis and a Research Fellow at the University of Basel.

I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Basel in spring 2019. During my PhD years I worked as a lecturer and research and teaching assistant in the [Economic Theory Group](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/economictheory/) led by [Prof. Aleksander Berentsen](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/berentsen/).

My current research is focused on the macroecnomics and monetary economics of developing countries with a particular emphasis on issues such as informality, financial inclusion and dollarization.

On this website you can find my detailed CV as well as an overview of my work.
