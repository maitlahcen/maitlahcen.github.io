**Welcome to my website!**

I'm a PhD student in applied economics at the University of Basel. My current research is focused on the monetary economics of developing countries. This includes issues such as informality and financial inclusion and the way they interact with inflation and monetary policy.

On this website you can find my detailed CV as well as a preview of my work.
