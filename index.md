**Welcome to my website!**

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Washington University in St Louis. I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Basel in spring 2019. During my PhD years I worked as a lecturer and research and teaching assistant in the [Economic Theory Group](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/economictheory/) led by [Prof. Aleksander Berentsen](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/berentsen/).

My current research is focused on macroecnomics and monetary economics with a particular emphasis on issues facing developing countries such as informality, financial inclusion and dollarization.

On this website you can find my detailed CV as well as an overview of my work.
