**Welcome to my website!**

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [Department of Finance and Economics](http://www.qu.edu.qa/business/academic-departments/finance) of Qatar University and a Research Fellow at the [Economic Theory Group](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/faculty/people/berentsen-aleksander-economic-theory/) of the University of Basel. I will join the International Monetary Fund as an Economist in September 2024.

My research interests lie in the field of macroeconomics and monetary economics with a particular emphasis on frictional markets.

I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Basel in 2019. Before joining Qatar University, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Economics of Washington University in St. Louis.

On this website you can find my detailed CV as well as an overview of my work.
