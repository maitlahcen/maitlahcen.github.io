**Welcome to my website!**

I am an Economist at the African Department of the [International Monetary Fund (IMF)](https://www.imf.org/en/Home). My research interests lie in the field of macroeconomics and monetary economics with a particular emphasis on markets with frictions.

Before joining the IMF, I was an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [Department of Finance and Economics](http://www.qu.edu.qa/business/academic-departments/finance) of Qatar University and a Research Fellow at the [Economic Theory Group](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/faculty/people/berentsen-aleksander-economic-theory/) of the University of Basel.

I obtained a PhD in Economics from the University of Basel in 2019. After that I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Department of Economics](https://economics.wustl.edu/) of Washington University in St. Louis.

On this website you can find my detailed CV as well as an overview of my work.
