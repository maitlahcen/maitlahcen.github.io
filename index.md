**Welcome to my website!**

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Washington University in St. Louis and a Research Fellow at the University of Basel. As of August 2020, I will be joining the Department of Finance and Economics at Qatar University as an Assistant Professor of Economics.

My current research is focused on the macro and monetary economics of developing countries with a particular emphasis on frictional and segmented markets and related issues such as informality and financial exclusion.

I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Basel in 2019. During my PhD years I worked as a lecturer and research and teaching assistant in the [Economic Theory Group](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/economictheory/) led by [Prof. Aleksander Berentsen](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/berentsen/).

On this website you can find my detailed CV as well as an overview of my work.
