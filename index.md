**Welcome to my website!**

I'm a PhD student in Economics at the University of Basel. I'm part of the [Chair of Economic Theory](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/economictheory/) held by [Prof. Aleksander Berentsen](https://wwz.unibas.ch/en/berentsen/) where I work as a lecturer, researcher and teaching assistant.

My current research is focused on the monetary economics of developing countries. I study various issues such as informality, financial inclusion and dollarization and the way they interact with monetary policy.

On this website you can find my detailed CV as well as a preview of my work.
