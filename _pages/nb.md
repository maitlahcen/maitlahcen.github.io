Below, I have listed some of my Python notebooks. All these notebooks and their dependencies are available at [my Github page](https://github.com/maitlahcen). Note that some of them are still work in progress.

### Numerical methods

* A simple example of a projection applied to the Neoclassical Growth Model: 
  - [Python notebook on QuantEcon Notes.](https://notes.quantecon.org/submission/5f4078b8d24fdb001162a53a)

* A projection algorithm applied to the Lucas asset pricing model: 
  - [Python notebook on QuantEcon Notes.](https://notes.quantecon.org/submission/5f44808ad24fdb001162a53b)

* A version of the Parameterized Expectations Algorithm applied to the Neoclassical Growth Model: 
  - [Python notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/maitlahcen/Projection/blob/master/PEA_ncgm.ipynb) (work in progress).

* Examples on the use of Chebyshev polynomials for function approximation:
