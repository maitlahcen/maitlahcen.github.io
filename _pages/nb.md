Below, I have listed some of my Python notebooks. All these notebooks and their dependencies are available at [my Github page](https://github.com/maitlahcen). Note that some of them are still work in progress.

## Projection methods

* A simple example of a projection applied to the Neoclassical Growth Model: 
  - [Python notebook.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/maitlahcen/Projection/blob/master/projection_ncgm.ipynb)

* A projection algorithm applied to the Lucas asset pricing model: 
  - [Python notebook.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/maitlahcen/Projection/blob/master/projection_lucas_apm.ipynb)
