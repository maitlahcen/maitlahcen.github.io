### Introduction to Python for Scientific Computing

I offer tutorials to Bachelor students where I teach an introduction to scientific computing in Python along with some basic economic applications (e.g. basic OLG models).

You can find the course material below as well as on my Github page:
* Course introduction ([pdf slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iv80644ta349nxe/intro_python.pdf?raw=1));
* Data types and structures, basic operations;
* Basic Numpy and Matplotlib;
* Numerical optimization and root finding with Scipy;
* Economic applications.
