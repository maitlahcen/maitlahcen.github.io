### Working Papers

#### [Informality and the Long Run Phillips Curve](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhpqz06u2is8yty/informality_lrpc_paper.pdf?raw=1) 

This paper studies the implications of informality for the long run relationship between inflation, output and unemployment in developing economies. I present a monetary dynamic general equilibrium model with search frictions in both labor and goods markets and where informality is an equilibrium outcome. Policies that lead to a larger informal sector result in an upward shift in both the money demand relation and the Beveridge curve. In contrast, financial development reduces informality and shifts both the Beveridge curve and the money demand relation downwards. An increase in the long run inflation rate affects unemployment through two channels: On the one hand, higher inflation reduces the surplus of monetary trades which lowers firms' profits, job creation and increases unemployment. On the other hand, it shifts firms' hiring decision from high separation and cash intensive informal jobs to low separation formal jobs which reduces unemployment. I calibrate the model to the Brazilian economy and find that the existence of a large informal sector significantly dampens the long run effects of monetary policy on unemployment and output. This result points to the importance of accounting for informality in the conduct of monetary policy in developing economies.

#### [A Model of Endogenous Financial Inclusion: Implications for Inequality and Monetary Policy](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0h2ug44u8r7f3b6/fin_incl_paper.pdf?raw=1), with [Pedro Gomis-Porqueras](https://sites.google.com/site/pedrogomisporqueras/)

We propose a monetary dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous credit market participation to study the impact of financial inclusion on welfare and inequality. We find that significant consumption inequality can result from limited access to basic financial services. In this environment, monetary policy has distributional consequences as agents face different liquidity constraints. This heterogeneity generates a pecuniary externality which can result in overconsumption of financially included agents above the socially efficient level. We conduct a quantitative assessment for the case of India. Our simple model is able to account for approximately a third of the observed consumption inequality. We analyze various policies aimed at increasing financial inclusion. As a result of pecuniary externalities, interest rate policies can result in a decrease in welfare and an increase in consumption inequality. Moreover, we find that a direct benefit transfer to bank account owners is superior to interest rate policies as it can increase welfare and reduce consumption inequality despite a decrease in individual consumption.

#### [Terms of Trade Shocks and Labor Market Dynamics in Commodity-Exporting Economies](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ljpah0isx7gn2a/comm_tot_lmdynamics_paper.pdf?raw=1)

This paper investigates the empirical and theoretical relationship between commodity terms of trade shocks and the dynamics of the labor market in commodity-exporting economies. I build a two-sector small open economy RBC model with labor search frictions and a fixed commodity supply and calibrate it to Chilean data. In this model, commodity price shocks operate mainly through the wealth channel. The resulting movements in the real exchange rate affect the allocation of production factors between the non-commodity tradable and non-tradable sectors. Compared to a standard Real Business Cycle model, I show that labor search and matching frictions contribute to the dampening of the shock which helps explain the Terms of Trade disconnect discussed in the literature. In addition, the resulting fluctuations in the real exchange rate generate significant sectoral reallocation of labor. This result is particularly amplified when capital is included in the model. The presence of capital along labor search frictions is also essential to replicate the negative reaction of unemployment to terms of trade shocks. Persistence is much stronger and consumption is less volatile as vacancy creation provides the economy with an additional mechanism through which it can smooth external shocks. As is the case with productivity shocks in closed economies, I show numerically that the fundamental surplus fraction matters for the transmission of terms of trade shocks to unemployment in open economies.

### Work in Progress

#### Monetary Policy in an Environment with Domestic and Foreign Denominated Bank Accounts, with [Pedro Gomis-Porqueras](https://sites.google.com/site/pedrogomisporqueras/) and [SÃ©bastien Lotz](http://lemma.u-paris2.fr/fr/node/35).

We revisit the issue of dollarization by focusing on the co-existence of domestic and foreign currency denominated bank accounts and the challenge this poses to monetary policy. We build on empirical evidence stating that sellers tend to prefer payments in local currency for small transactions while they prefer foreign currency for large transactions. We use this observation to build a New Monetarist model which features equilibria with bank deposits and loans in both currencies. This setting allows us to study issues such as the benefit of allowing foreign currency denominated bank accounts, the implications on money demand and the nominal exchange rate of regulations that discriminate among assets and liabilities based on their currency denomination (e.g. differential reserve requirements).
