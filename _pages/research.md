**Money, Inflation, and Unemployment in the Presence of Informality** 

*Abstract*: I study the long-run relationship between money, inflation, unemployment, and the informal sector in a search-theoretic model with informality in both labor and goods markets and where money and credit coexist. The steady-state equilibrium solution of the model is calibrated to match certain characteristics of the US and Brazilian economies. The model is able to replicate most of the stylized facts observed in the data.
