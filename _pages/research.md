### Work in Progress

#### Money, Inflation, and Unemployment in the Presence of Informality

This paper studies the impact of informality on the long-run relation between inflation and unemployment in developing economies. I present a dynamic general equilibrium model with informality in both labor and goods markets and where money and credit coexist. An increase in inflation affects unemployment through two channels: the matching channel and the hiring channel. On one hand, higher inflation reduces the surplus of monetary trades thus lowering firms entry and increasing unemployment. On the other hand, the lower impact of inflation on formal transactions where credit is partially available shifts the hiring decision towards formal jobs with a lower separation rate thus reducing unemployment. The matching technology in the goods market provides an amplification mechanism which can strengthen both channels. The equilibrium effect is ambiguous and depends on the size of the informal sector and the availability of credit in formal transactions. The model is calibrated to match some long-run aspects of the Brazilian economy. Preliminary results show that inflation produces little effect on unemployment but has a significant effect on labor allocation between formal and informal jobs.
