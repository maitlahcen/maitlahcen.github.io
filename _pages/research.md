### Work in Progress

#### Money, Inflation, and Unemployment in the Presence of Informality

I study the long-run relationship between money, inflation, unemployment, and the informal sector in a search-theoretic model with informality in both labor and goods markets and where money and credit coexist.

The model is able to replicate most of the stylized facts observed in the data.
