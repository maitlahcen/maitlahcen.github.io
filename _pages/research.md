### Work in Progress

#### Money, Inflation, and Unemployment in the Presence of Informality

I study the long-run relationship between money, inflation, unemployment, and the informal sector in a search-theoretic model with informality in both labor and goods markets and where money and credit coexist. The steady-state equilibrium solution of the model is calibrated to match certain characteristics of the US and Brazilian economies. The model is able to replicate most of the stylized facts observed in the data.



### Master thesis

#### DSGE models for developing economies: an application to Morocco

In this thesis I try to understand the impact of some macroeconomic features of developing economies, in particular the existence of a large informal sector, on the reaction of these economies to different shocks. In order to achieve this objective, I write a simple New Keynesian small open economy DSGE model featuring multiple sectors with monopolistic competition, nominal rigidities in prices, a fixed exchange rate regime and the introduction of a simple medium-sized informal sector. I estimate the model with Bayesian estimation using quarterly data from Morocco. The model does a good job in capturing the unconditional second moments of the data. It is also able to replicate relatively well some of the historical data series. Estimation results suggest a relatively weaker role of price rigidities in the non-tradables sector. It also suggests a much more aggressive reaction of the central bank to inflationary pressures with a relatively higher weight given to fluctuations in inflation compared with fluctuations in output and the real exchange rate. The study of the impulse-response functions confirms the shock absorbing role of the informal sector for productivity shocks and pleads towards excluding imported inflation from the inflation target. No evidence is found of a shock absorbing role of the informal sector in the case of interest rate or foreign demand shocks.
